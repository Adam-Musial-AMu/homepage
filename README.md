## Description
Visualization, sometimes called meditation, is an extremely effective method of working with the subconscious, which plays a huge role in creating our attitudes, both in difficult and stressful situations, where it helps us find courage and confidence, as well as in the creative processes of creating our reality.  It also often has relaxation qualities and helps us regain our lost inner balance. Not everyone knows that using visualization techniques you can effectively change your attitude towards the world around you and thus create and effectively achieve your goals. Make your dreams come true. 
I invite you to the magical world of my visualizations....
